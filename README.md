# FIRST Robotics
ROBOTS ARE TAKING OVER THE WORLD

## What is it?

Well, FIRST Robotics is a compitetion for high schoolsers who want to build robots and have fun doing it. Each year a new course, new obsticals, and new robots are built and challange high schoolers of all experence levels to build and create. However, what it is **NOT** is BattleBots. Seriously, if you are in robotics its something you'll get annoyed with people asking BattleBots gives robotics compitetions in general a bad name because no matter what you do you will always end up being asked if your robots try and blow each other up. They have feelings too!

## How does it work?

Every year an arena is designed, this arena will have different goals for teams of 3 to complete. Tasks range from lifting boxes, to crossing obstacles, to launching balls. Robotics teams will be participating 3 v 3 against other teams in alliances. Each team has 6 weeks to build a completely new robot to compete against teams from all over the world.
