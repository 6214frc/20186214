# WORK IN PROGRESS

# Contributing to the robot code

Its fairly simple but requires an annoying amount of setup to get ready. I hope this will be the simplest guide to downloading and installing everything you need.

## Downloading software

The most tedious part. In order to actually get into programming even the smallest bit you will need to download several things.

### An is IDE recommended. Default is Eclipse but you can use any that you want.
* [Eclipse Download](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/) OR any [Integrated Development Environment](http://bfy.tw/Gu0j) you want use eclipse if you don't know anything.
* [Java is required for various tools for the roborio](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
* [FRC C++ Toolchain](http://first.wpi.edu/FRC/roborio/toolchains/)
* [FRC Update Suite](http://www.ni.com/download/first-robotics-software-2017/7183/en/)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* [TalonSRX CAN Bus libs](http://www.ctr-electronics.com/talon-srx.html#product_tabs_technical_resources) This is only needed if you use the talonSRX with the CAN Bus (The green and yellow wires)

## Installing stuff

You know the usual procedure. Some of these will require a restart in order to take effect however. The ones that will be a little annoying to deal with however is the FRC Update suite. Not only do you have to create a National Instruments Account it will require a key to install, this is included in your Kit of Parts (KOP) If you do not know this then feel free to ask team members. You only need to put it in once but make sure you have it written down for the future.
