Its fairly simple but requires an annoying amount of setup to get ready. I hope this will be the simplest guide to downloading and installing everything you need.

## Downloading stuff

The most tedious part. In order to actually get into programming even the smallest bit you will need to download several things.

### An is IDE recommended. Default is Eclipse but you can use any that you want.
* [Eclipse Download](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/) OR any [Intergrated Development Environment](http://bfy.tw/Gu0j) you want use eclipse if you don't know anything.
* [Java is required for various tools for the roborio](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
* [FRC C++ Toolchain](http://first.wpi.edu/FRC/roborio/toolchains/)
* [FRC Update Suite](http://www.ni.com/download/first-robotics-software-2017/7183/en/)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
